// Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.
// Sets up details about a smartphone
var smartphone = {
    make: "Oppo",
    model: "Oppo A78 5G",
    specs: {
        storage: "12GB",
        screenSize: "7.2 inches",
        batteryLife: "20 hours"
    }
};
console.log(smartphone);
console.log(smartphone.specs);
//                              XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
// Question 53: Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.
var developerSkills = {
    languages: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python"],
    frameworks: ["React", "MongoDB", "MVC"],
    tools: ["Git", "Webpack", "Docker"]
};
var languages = developerSkills.languages, frameworks = developerSkills.frameworks, tools = developerSkills.tools;
console.log("Language: ".concat(languages[1], ", Framework: ").concat(frameworks[1], ", Tool: ").concat(tools[0]));
//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
// Question 54: Making Flexible Object Keys: Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section based on what you need at that moment, like adjusting labels based on user choices.
function createObjectWithDynamicKey(key, value) {
    var dynamicObject = {};
    dynamicObject[key] = value;
    return dynamicObject;
}
var userPreference = createObjectWithDynamicKey("theme", "dark");
console.log(userPreference);
//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
