let car={
    color:"White",
    make:"Toyota",
    model:"Corolla",

//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// Question 81: Iterating Over Object Properties: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.

function logObjectProperties(obj:object) {
    for (let property in obj){
        console.log(`${property}: ${obj[property]}`);

console.log(logObjectProperties({ make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2021, color: "Black" }));
