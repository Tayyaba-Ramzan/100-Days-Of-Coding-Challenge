// Question 70: Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.
function printNumberWithLet() {
    for (let i=1;i<=5;i++){
        console.log(i);
        
    }
}
printNumberWithLet();

//                         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// Question 71: Compare let and const: Create two examples where let allows reassignment but const does not. Try to reassign a const-declared variable and catch the error.

// Difference Between Let & Const

// Let
let age:number=20;
age=22;
console.log(age);

// Const
const myName:string="Tayyaba";
try {
    myName="Tayyaba Ramzan";
} catch (error) {
    console.log("Error: Can't reassign a `const`-declared variable.");
}

//                         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// Question 72: Block Scope with let and const: Demonstrate block scope by creating a code block with {} that uses both let and const. Show how variables declared inside the block are not accessible outside of it.

{
    let blockLet = "visible inside the block";
    const blockConst = "also only inside the block";
    console.log(blockLet); 
    console.log(blockConst); 
}
try {
    console.log(blockLet); // This will fail
} catch (error) {
    console.log("`blockLet` is not accessible outside the block.");
}
try {
    console.log(blockConst); // This will also fail
} catch (error) {
    console.log("`blockConst` is not accessible outside the block.");
}

//                         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
