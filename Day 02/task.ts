// Question 4: Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
// "Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"

console.log(`Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”`);

//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// Question 5: Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to them, like “Hello Asharib, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

let famousPersonName: string = "Tayyaba Ramzan";
let message: string = `Hello ${famousPersonName}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`;
console.log(message);

//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// Question 6: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

let myName: string = "\t\nTayyaba Ramzan\t\n";
console.log(myName);
console.log(myName.trim());

//                               XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
